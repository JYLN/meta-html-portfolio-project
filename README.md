# Meta Frontend HTML/CSS Portfolio Project

This is my submission for the Meta portfolio project that is the end of the `HTML and CSS in Depth` course. The grading criteria/project requirements is as follows:

## Visual layout

When viewing the home page in the browser:

- Is it clear that this is a home page for one of the four fictional clients?
- Is the correct company logo at the top of the page?
- Is there a horizontal navigation menu with four links below the logo?
- Does one of the links in the navigation menu link to the home page itself?
- Does the main content contain a large promotional banner at the top and three columns below it, each containing an image and some text?
- Does the page have a footer that is split into two columns?
- Does the left column of the footer contain a small version of the client logo and the right column copyright text?

## Semantic structure

When opening the HTML file in VS Code, does it contain:

- A header element for the logo?
- A nav element for the navigation menu?
- A main element for the content?
- A footer element for the footer?
- Appropriate usage of other semantic tags such as article and section in the content of the main element?

## CSS layout, styling and effects

When viewing the home page in the browser:

- Is the use of CSS styling effective?
- Is CSS used to create appropriate interactivity?

## Overall effect of the home page

- Does the home page create adequate interaction and a pleasing visual experience that is fitting for the client and its customers?
- Are CSS styling and effects used effectively to create intentional engagement?
- What works well?
